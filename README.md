# double-retirement

Traditionally, retirement planning has focused on building a portfolio that will sustain a 30-year retirement (e.g. retire at age 65 with enough funds to last until age 95). Historical analysis has shown that withdrawing 4% of a portfolio in each year of retirement has a 95% chance of successfully funding a 30-year retirement. This assumes a 50/50 asset allocation of equities (S&P index) and bonds (10-year Treasury yield). It also assumes that the withdrawal amount is adjusted for inflation each year.

As people live longer and try to retire earlier, it would be helpful to examine retirement planning over a longer time horizon. A growing number of people live past the age of 100, and a movement focused on retiring early has gained momentum in recent years. Under such circumstances, what is the probability of a retirement portfolio lasting 60 years instead of 30 years at a 4% withdrawal rate? Would a lower withdrawal rate increase the probability of success significantly?
